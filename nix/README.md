The files in this directory are generated by the /bundix script.

The reason for that is that currently `bundlerEnv` doesn't copy the gemspec into the special `gemfile-and-lockfile` derivation.

The problem is that the Gemfile contains `gemspec` so bundler tries to look for gemspec in the `gemfile-and-lockfile` folder.

See https://github.com/nix-community/bundix/issues/10

A workaround is to generate a Gemfile where every depdendency is included directly.
